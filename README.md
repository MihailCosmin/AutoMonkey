Python Automation using Mouse and Keyboard, for the masses

# Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/MihailCosmin/AutoMonkey
```

# Usage
Main function to be used is "chain"  

This will allow you to "chain" together most of the other functions of automonkey.  
Which in turn will enable you to create sequences of mouse and/or keyboard actions in order to automate any given task.

A step can have this structure:

```python

dict(
    <action> = <target>,  # action can be any of the automonkey functions, target on which the action will be performed
    wait = 1,  # wait is an optional parameter, which will wait for the given amount of seconds before executing the next step
    skip = False,  # if True, will skip this step
    confidence = 0.9, # confidence is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Confidence on locating the image.
    v_offset = 0,  # v_offset is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Vertical offset from the center of the image.
    h_offset = 0,  # h_offset is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Horizontal offset from the center of the image.
    offset = 0, # offset is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Offset from the center of the image.
    monitor = 0,  # monitor is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Monitor on which to search for the image.
)

or 

{
    "<action>": "<target>",  # action can be any of the automonkey functions, target on which the action will be performed
    "wait": 1,  # wait is an optional parameter, which will wait for the given amount of seconds before executing the next step
    "skip": False,  # if True, will skip this step
    "confidence": 0.9, # confidence is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Confidence on locating the image.
    "v_offset": 0,  # v_offset is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Vertical offset from the center of the image.
    "h_offset": 0,  # h_offset is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Horizontal offset from the center of the image.
    "offset": 0, # offset is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Offset from the center of the image.
    "monitor": 0,  # monitor is an optional parameter, Used only for actions on images. Monitor on which to search for the image.
}
```

1. You can connect multiple click (or rightclick) actions together by using the "chain" function. Just by doing this you can generally automate most of the tasks you would do on a daily basis.

    There are 2 main ways to click, either by giving the coordinates of the position where to click or by giving the filename of the image you want to click on

    1.1. Clicking by coordinates
        
    
    1.1.1. In order to find the coordinates of a position on the screen you can use the "track_mouse" function or the PositionTracker class

    ```python
        from automonkey import track_mouse
        track_mouse()
    ```

    <img alt="track_mouse" src="demo/track_mouse.gif" width="416px" height="304px"/>


    ```python
        from automonkey import PositionTracker
        PositionTracker()
    ```

    <img alt="PositionTracker" src="demo/PositionTracker.gif" width="918px" height="574px"/>

    1.2.1. Now that you have the coordinates of the position you want to click on, you can use the "chain" function to click on it


    ```python
        from automonkey import chain
        chain(  
            dict(click=(780, 1175), wait=1),  
            dict(click=(444, 194), wait=1),  
            dict(click=(1892, 110), wait=1),  
            debug=True  
        )
    ```

    <img alt="click" src="demo/click.gif" width="960px" height="576px"/>

    1.2. Clicking by image

    1.2.1. To click on an image you first need to make a screenshot of the area you want to click on and save it somewhere on your computer.
        For this you can use any screenshot tool you want, or you could use monkeyshot: https://github.com/MihailCosmin/monkeyshot
        For example you can make a screenshot of the Edge icon from your toolbar, then we can click on it by using the "chain" function.

    <img alt="edge_toolbar" src="demo/edge_toolbar.jpg" width="33px" height="33px"/>

    1.2.2. Now that we have the image we want to click on, we can use the "chain" function to click on it

    ```python
        chain(
            dict(click="demo/edge_toolbar.jpg"),
            dict(click="demo/google_create_account", wait=1),
            dict(click="demo/personal_use", wait=1),
            debug=True
        )
    ```

    <img alt="click_image" src="demo/click_image.gif" width="918px" height="600px"/>

    1.3. All click actions:

        * click
        * rightclick
        * leftclick
        * doubleclick
        * tripleclick
        * scrollup
        * scrolldown
        * scrollleft
        * scrollright

2. You can also connect multiple keyboard actions together by using the "chain" function.

    2.1. Write text - This doesn't work well with non-english character. For this you can use the "pastetext" function.

    ```python
        chain(
            dict(click="demo/notepad.jpg"),
            dict(write="Hello World!"),
            debug=True
        )
    ```

    <img alt="write" src="demo/write.gif" width="918px" height="600px"/>

    2.2. Paste text - This works well with non-english characters

    ```python
        chain(
            dict(click="demo/notepad.jpg"),
            dict(pastetext="Stra√üe"),
            debug=True
        )
    ```

    2.3. Key combinations

    ```python
        chain(
            dict(click="demo/notepad.jpg", wait=1),
            dict(write="Hello World!", wait=1),
            dict(keys2="ctrl+a", wait=1),
            dict(keys2="ctrl+x", wait=1),
            dict(keys2="alt+f4", wait=1),  # close notepad
            debug=True
        )
    ```

    <img alt="keys" src="demo/keys.gif" width="918px" height="600px"/>

    2.4. All key actions:

        * write
        * pastetext
        * keys
        * keys2 - best option overall for key combinations
        * keys3
        * keys4
        * copy
        * paste
